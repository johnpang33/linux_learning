WSL: Allow linux to run on windows

To install WSL:
1. Control panel --> programs --> Turn on windows features --> Windows subsystem for linux
2. Need to reboot the PC
3. Need to install a linux distribution
4. Windows store --> Ubuntu LTS (long term support)
We can use Debian too.

Launch from the start menu: 
It is a very minimal system so there is no gcc or python
EXECUTE sudo apt-get update
EXECUTE sudo apt-get install gcc


nano helloworld.c
gcc helloworld.c
./a.out

EXECUTE sudo apt install python3-pip
EXECUTE sudo pip3 install -U netmiko


df -h
cd /mnt/c

WSL is like a container, we can open multiple linux windows

Download Windows Terminal from MicroSoft store

# Set wsl to version 2
EXECUTE wsl --set-version NAME 2
EXECUTE wsl -l -v



EXECUTE uname -a
EXECUTE lsb_release -a
